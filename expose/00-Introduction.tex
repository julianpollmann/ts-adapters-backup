\section{Introduction}
Machine Learning (ML) approaches for Natural Language Processing tasks like
Text Simplification (TS) often require a large amount of data during training.
Since in some languages more training data is available Machine Learning models
trained on this data can perform better than models trained on low resource languages.
In this context one approach could be to take advantage of what a model from a high resource
language learned and apply this to the domain of the low resource language, which is
called Transfer Learning.
Adapters for Transformer based architectures are a recent approach that promise to tackle this issue.
The aim of this master thesis is to investigate how suitable adapters are to solve this cross-lingual transfer
and to examine potential drawbacks to this approach. 
%They solve this by inserting own layers in between pretrained models and enhancing language and task transfer.

\subsection{Motivation}
%* Why Text Simplification?
% Large amount of data is necessary
% In one Language larger amounts of data are available, in others no
%The developments of recent years in the field of Natural Language Processing is based on deep-learning approaches,
%which are fed with training data. 
Recent developments in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated the power of
these tools. Machine Learning based approaches drive Tools for Chatbots, Machine Translation or Text Simplification, and 
they have in common that they try to support humans in their tasks.
Text Simplification, for example, aims to make a Text simpler and better to understand while preserving its meaning.
Simplified Texts can assist users with reading difficulties, language learners or people with other challenges.
Models for Text Simplification are commonly created by fine-tuning a pretrained model with a large amount of textual data.
But data for this kind of task is sparse and is even less available in low resource languages, like e.g. German.
Manually creating this training data is costly and time-consuming and retraining in every language is very inefficient and slow.

\subsection{Need for Research}
One solution to tackle the data sparsity problem is to use transfer learning, where in the case of Text Simplification learnings from a high
resource language can be transferred to a low resource language. Adapters for Transformer based architectures are a recent approach
that promise to enable this transfer and encapsulate the learnings for easier model sharing.
Additionally they achieve performance similar to completely fine-tuned models on most tasks.~\cite{Pfeiffer2020}
However it is questionable whether the quality of Text Simplifications with adapters is on par with that of fully fine-tuned models.
Also further research is necessary, if the transfer from a high resource language to a low resource language yields comparable results.
Therefore this thesis will investigate following aspects of adapters.

\subsection{Research Questions}
Given the previous undiscovered aspects of adapters following research questions could be made:

\textbf{How effective are adapters for cross-lingual transfer on text simplification tasks?}
