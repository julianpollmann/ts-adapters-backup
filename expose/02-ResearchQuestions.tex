\section{Research QuestionsRelated Work}
This thesis will investigate the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    %\item[] \textbf{How effective are adapters compared to fully fine-tuned models using only monolingual data?}
    %\item[] \textbf{How effective are adapters for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on text simplification models?}
    \item \textbf{How effective are monolingual models with adapters when compared to fully-fine tuned models?}\label{rq:1}
    \item \textbf{How effective are adapters for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on text simplification models?}\label{rq:2}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How does a zero-shot model compare to a model which has seen training data in the target language?\label{rq:2.1}
        \item How efficient are adapters compared to fully fine-tuned models in terms of their parameters and the cost of training?\label{rq:2.2}
        \item How does the effectiveness change when training text simplification models at sentence, paragraph and document level?\label{rq:2.3}
        %\item How different is the quality of text simplification between a fine-tuned model and an adapter trained in a different language?
        %\item \emph{How efficient are adapters compared to fine-tuned models regarding their parameter size?}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{What are the limitations of using adapters as a way of cross-lingual transfer?}\label{rq:3}
\end{enumerate}
